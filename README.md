This is a test project for the Odin Project's Foundations course. In fact, it is the first project.

I have put into action several skills including writing some basic html like lists, links, headers, images, and boilerplate html. The project is a recipe website consisting of a homepage and 3 recipes at this stage which link to and from each other. There is currently no CSS.
