        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The fabled Okayama scramble, invented in the prefecture neighboring Hiroshima from which it got its name, took years to perfect. First there were bell peppers, then piman. Then there was shreaded mozza and cheddar before I landed on parmesan. Occasionally I'll add shiitake mushrooms or eringi.</p>
        <p>You can mix and match whatever ingredients you want to, but these are the ones that I recommend for a guaranteed hit that'll start any weekend off right. It combines smoke, spice, and umami for a breakfast made in heaven.</p>
